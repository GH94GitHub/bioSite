                Kayla was born in Kearney, NE at the Good Sam hospital at 12:23pm. Although she was born there she grew up in Lexington Nebraska. She lived the country life growing up and at age three her parents split up. Growing up with three dogs (Puddles, Pistol and Tonka) and two cats (Evil and Swiffer), she had lots of pets but Evil her cat was her favorite. She says when she was young she used to put Evil in a play stroller and wheel him around, and that she used to cuddle him every night at bedtime. </p>

                <p>Every summer they would go to her Grandparents house in Colorado near the mountains, where her entire family would meet. Kayla and her cousins would goof around and play on rocks near the house, and play around the river where there was a cliff they could jump off into the river. Her favorite thing she can remember of her young years was a huge hiking and camping trip to a remote lake upon a 14-thousand mile high mountain, it's safe to say she grew up an adventurer.</p>
